# Menu-Solutions
Menu Solutions is a web based menu planning tool enabling the modern family to eat a home cooked healthy diet.
It allows users to add their family members along with their dietary requirements. The user then inputs each week who will be eating on each day and the time they have available to prepare a meal. My algorithm considers all of this information to generate a meal plan for the user with healthy simple recipes that suit everyone's needs. It also generates a shopping list containing all the required ingredients.

It was written as part of my Computer Science A Level course but has been developed far beyond the requirements. This is an older version as the current production version uses the Laravel Framework to improve security and speed of development.
